## Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Technology Comparison | Compare frameworks and libraries with weighted scoring |
| TCO Analysis | Calculate 5-year total cost including hidden costs |
| Ecosystem Health | Assess GitHub metrics, npm adoption, community strength |
| Security Assessment | Evaluate vulnerabilities and compliance readiness |
| Migration Analysis | Estimate effort, risks, and timeline for migrations |
| Cloud Comparison | Compare AWS, Azure, GCP for specific workloads |

## Quick Start

### Compare Two Technologies

```
Compare React vs Vue for a SaaS dashboard.
Priorities: developer productivity (40%), ecosystem (30%), performance (30%).
```

### Calculate TCO

```
Calculate 5-year TCO for Next.js on Vercel.
Team: 8 developers. Hosting: $2500/month. Growth: 40%/year.
```

### Assess Migration

```
Evaluate migrating from Angular.js to React.
Codebase: 50,000 lines, 200 components. Team: 6 developers.
```

---

## Input Formats

The evaluator accepts three input formats:

**Text** - Natural language queries
```
Compare PostgreSQL vs MongoDB for our e-commerce platform.
```

**YAML** - Structured input for automation
```yaml
comparison:
  technologies: ["React", "Vue"]
  use_case: "SaaS dashboard"
  weights:
    ecosystem: 30
    performance: 25
    developer_experience: 45
```

**JSON** - Programmatic integration
```json
{
  "technologies": ["React", "Vue"],
  "use_case": "SaaS dashboard"
}
```

## Evidence Sources

Use current, verifiable evidence. For fast local review, inspect manifests and lockfiles. For current ecosystem and pricing claims, verify against primary sources before presenting numbers.

Useful local commands:

```bash
rg --files
cat package.json
npm view <package> version
npm audit --audit-level=high
pnpm why <package>
```

Useful evidence categories:

| Category | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| Fit | Product requirements, team skills, integration needs |
| Cost | Hosting, licenses, staff ramp-up, migration effort, operations |
| Ecosystem | Release cadence, issue health, package adoption, documentation |
| Security | CVEs, maintenance status, auth/data handling maturity |
| Migration | Compatibility gaps, rewrite surface, parallel-run strategy |

---

## Confidence Levels

| Level | Score | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| High | 80-100% | Clear winner, strong data |
| Medium | 50-79% | Trade-offs present, moderate uncertainty |
| Low | < 50% | Close call, limited data |

## When to Use

- Comparing frontend/backend frameworks for new projects
- Evaluating cloud providers for specific workloads
- Planning technology migrations with risk assessment
- Calculating build vs. buy decisions with TCO
- Assessing open-source library viability

## When NOT to Use

- Trivial decisions between similar tools (use team preference)
- Mandated technology choices (decision already made)
- Emergency production issues (use monitoring tools)
